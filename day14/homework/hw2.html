    <p>It was one of those weirdly quiet mornings.<br> The kind where everything feels like it’s holding its breath. Jamie sat at the kitchen table, staring at the<br> blinking cursor on their laptop screen, half a coffee deep and still not awake enough to form a thought. Outside, the street<br> was empty except for an old guy walking a dog that didn’t seem interested in walking.</p>
