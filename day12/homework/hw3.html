    <h1>Why Saved images are better than linked ones</h1>
    <p>1.Faster Loading – Locally saved images load quicker since they don’t depend on an external server.</p>

    <p>2.Reliability – External image links can break if the original site removes or changes the image.</p>
        
    <p>3.No Internet Dependency – Saved images work even if the user is offline or if the external server is down.</p>
        
    <p>4.Better Control – You can optimize, resize, and compress the images without relying on an external source.</p>
        
    <p>5.No Privacy or Copyright Issues – Some linked images might be copyrighted, which could cause legal problems.</p>
