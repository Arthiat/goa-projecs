    <h1>Koenigsegg</h1> 
    <p>Koenigsegg Automotive AB is a Swedish manufacturer of high-performance sports cars based in Ängelholm, Skåne County, Sweden.</p>

    <p>Koenigsegg cars have on several occasions broken various production car speed records.</p>

    <p>The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a "world-class" sports car. Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company's first street-legal production car, which was introduced in 2002.</p>

    <p>In 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States, whose strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models.</p>

    <p>In March 2009, the CCXR was listed by Forbes as one of "the world's most beautiful cars".</p>
